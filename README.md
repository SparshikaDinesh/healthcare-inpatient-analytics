# Healthcare Inpatient Analytics: BI Dashboard & Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end healthcare analytics solution combining
Business Intelligence (Power BI) and Machine Learning to analyze inpatient
claims data. The goal is to uncover trends in hospital utilization and build
predictive models for healthcare costs.

The project demonstrates data engineering, visualization, and predictive
modeling skills using real-world healthcare data.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides interactive insights into inpatient claims data,
including:

- Inpatient Claims Count by Year
- Average Length of Stay by Year
- Average Length of Stay by Age Group
- Year-based filtering using slicers

Dashboard screenshots are available in the `dashboard_screenshots/` folder.

## 🤖 Machine Learning
### Objective
Predict inpatient healthcare costs using patient demographics and admission
details.

### Models Implemented
- **Linear Regression** (baseline model)
- **Random Forest Regressor** (improved performance)

### Evaluation
- Models evaluated using RMSE
- Random Forest achieved better performance than Linear Regression
- Feature importance analysis used for model interpretation
